Got it üëç You‚Äôre asking about **React.js interview prep**.
Here are the **Top 5 React.js interview questions** (commonly asked in 2024‚Äì2025):

---

### 1. **What is React, and what are its key features?**

* React is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**, mainly for single-page applications (SPA).
* Key features:

  * **Virtual DOM** (efficient UI updates).
  * **Component-based architecture**.
  * **Unidirectional data flow (props ‚Üí children)**.
  * **JSX** syntax for templating.

---

### 2. **What is the difference between functional and class components?**

* **Class Components**: Use `extends React.Component`, have lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, etc.), and use `this.state`.
* **Functional Components**: Plain JS functions, use **hooks** (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and lifecycle.
* Modern React prefers **functional components with hooks**.

---

### 3. **What are React Hooks, and why are they important?**

* Hooks let you use **state** and **lifecycle features** in functional components.
* Common hooks:

  * `useState` ‚Üí state management
  * `useEffect` ‚Üí side effects (API calls, subscriptions)
  * `useContext` ‚Üí context API for global state
  * `useMemo` / `useCallback` ‚Üí performance optimization
* They eliminate the need for class components.

---

### 4. **What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?**

* **Controlled components**: Form inputs controlled by React state (`value` bound to state + `onChange`).
* **Uncontrolled components**: Form inputs handled by the DOM, accessed with `ref`.
* Controlled components are more common in React apps.

---

### 5. **How does React handle reconciliation and Virtual DOM?**

* React uses a **Virtual DOM** to minimize real DOM updates.
* On state/prop changes:

  * React creates a new Virtual DOM tree.
  * It **diffs** the new vs old tree.
  * Only the changed nodes are updated in the real DOM.
* This makes React very efficient.

üëâ **Bonus Advanced Questions**:

* What is React Fiber?
* How do you optimize performance in React?
* What are higher-order components (HOC) and render props?
* What is Context API vs Redux?

Do you want me to expand with a **cheat sheet including mini code snippets** for each question (so you can revise quickly before interview), like I did for Node.js?
