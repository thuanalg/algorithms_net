Here are **Top 5 common OpenGL ES (OpenGL for Embedded Systems) interview questions** you might encounter:

---

### 1. **What is the difference between OpenGL and OpenGL ES?**

* Explain how OpenGL ES is a subset of OpenGL designed for mobile/embedded devices.
* Highlight reduced feature set (no immediate mode, fewer functions, no deprecated fixed pipeline in ES 2.0+).
* Discuss performance and power efficiency considerations.

---

### 2. **What are the main versions of OpenGL ES and their key differences?**

* **OpenGL ES 1.x** â†’ Fixed-function pipeline.
* **OpenGL ES 2.0** â†’ Programmable pipeline with shaders (vertex/fragment).
* **OpenGL ES 3.0/3.1/3.2** â†’ Adds features like instanced rendering, transform feedback, compute shaders, and advanced texture formats.

---

### 3. **How does the rendering pipeline work in OpenGL ES?**

* Input assembler â†’ Vertex Shader â†’ Rasterization â†’ Fragment Shader â†’ Output Merger.
* Mention role of programmable shaders (vertex & fragment).
* Be able to sketch or explain the pipeline steps clearly.

---

### 4. **What are VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects) and why are they important in OpenGL ES?**

* Used to store vertex data (positions, normals, texture coordinates) in GPU memory.
* Minimizes CPUâ€“GPU data transfer overhead.
* Essential for performance on embedded/mobile devices.

---

### 5. **How do shaders work in OpenGL ES?**

* Explain GLSL ES (OpenGL Shading Language for ES).
* Vertex Shader: transforms vertex positions, passes attributes.
* Fragment Shader: computes color/pixel output.
* Linking shaders into a program and using `glUseProgram`.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Bonus Questions (if interview is deeper):

* How do you manage context loss in OpenGL ES (especially on Android)?
* Whatâ€™s the difference between `glTexImage2D` and `glTexSubImage2D`?
* How to optimize rendering for battery-constrained devices?
* Difference between EGL and OpenGL ES?

Do you want me to also prepare **short sample answers** for each of these 5 questions (like an interview-ready cheat sheet)?
