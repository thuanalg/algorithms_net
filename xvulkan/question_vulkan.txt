Here are **Top 5 common Vulkan interview questions** that candidates are often asked, ranging from fundamentals to practical usage:

---

### 1. **What are the main differences between Vulkan and OpenGL?**

* Interviewers want to see if you understand why Vulkan exists.
* Key points:

  * Vulkan is low-level, explicit, closer to the hardware.
  * Better multi-threading support.
  * No implicit global state (unlike OpenGL).
  * More verbose API, but higher performance and predictability.

---

### 2. **What is a Vulkan Instance and why is it required?**

* Expected answer:

  * A **Vulkan Instance** represents the connection between your application and the Vulkan library/driver.
  * It is the first object you create in a Vulkan app.
  * Used to query extensions, layers, and available physical devices (GPUs).

---

### 3. **Can you explain the Vulkan memory model and how resource allocation works?**

* Vulkan requires explicit memory management.
* Expected points:

  * Buffers and images are not automatically backed by memory.
  * You must query memory types with `vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties`.
  * Allocate memory with `vkAllocateMemory` and bind it with `vkBindBufferMemory` / `vkBindImageMemory`.
  * Different memory types: device-local, host-visible, coherent, cached, etc.

---

### 4. **What are command buffers and why are they important in Vulkan?**

* Command buffers record rendering and compute commands.
* They are later submitted to **queues** for execution by the GPU.
* Benefits:

  * Efficient multi-threading (multiple threads can build command buffers).
  * Reduces CPU overhead compared to immediate mode APIs.
* Interviewers may ask the difference between **primary** and **secondary** command buffers.

---

### 5. **What are Descriptor Sets in Vulkan?**

* Descriptor sets describe how shaders access buffers and images.
* Interviewers want to check if you know how Vulkan manages resources.
* Key points:

  * They are allocated from a **Descriptor Pool**.
  * They bind resources (uniform buffers, storage buffers, samplers, images) to shaders.
  * Binding is explicit at draw/dispatch time via `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets`.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Bonus advanced questions you might also encounter:

* How does Vulkan handle synchronization (fences, semaphores, barriers)?
* What is the difference between SPIR-V and GLSL?
* How does Vulkan achieve multi-GPU support?

Do you want me to also prepare **short sample answers** for each question (like a quick cheat sheet), or do you prefer **detailed explanations with diagrams/code snippets** for deeper prep?
